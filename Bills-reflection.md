#Bills Reflection

*My greatest struggle prior to the pairing sessions was being able to properly upload and interegrate files with GitHub.
*Many things were clarified during my GPS, from conceptual questions about how branching actually works in a group's workflow, to learning more about and becoming more comfortable with git commands.
*I asked a number of questions about merge conflicts, and how resolving them seems often to involve more discussion about the nature of the project than trouble-shooting errors.
*I'm beginning to see and understand that git it a powerful and complex tool. The little of it that I currently know leaves me excited to explore the rest of its features, though I feel I have a good grasp on the basics right now.
*My first pairing exeperience was not to be as my partner had to reschedule at the last minute. However, I deeply enjoyed working with a guide, and felt very empowered during the whole session. I may, though there is no proof of this, have shouted at one point, "We're hacking into the mainframe!"
